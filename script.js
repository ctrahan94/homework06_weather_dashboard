// hahhaha yeah mine worked i didnt change my variable

// Tessa  10:41 AM
// taylor did you use this for the weather homework?

// Brendon Hart  10:42 AM
// isnâ€™t this the exact same concept? We would just have to change the code so it was applicable

// Tessa  10:42 AM
// yep so that if the user clicks on a button that they created (cities), it displays that weather

// taylor hackbart  10:42 AM
// yes i did!

// Tessa  10:42 AM
// I'm more concerned about the display and UI than I am the ajax stuff

// Brendon Hart  10:43 AM
// then all we have to add is just the code that inserts the information into the text areas

// taylor hackbart  10:43 AM
// i hardcoded my display

// Tessa  10:43 AM
// I feel like we didn't spend a ton of time on design

// Brendon Hart  10:43 AM
// I wish we had spent more time on CSS layour
